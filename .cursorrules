i will be talking about the nfl big data bowl 2025, here are the rules:
do not use jupyter notebooks anywhere.

the data sets are tracking_week_1.csv and tracking_week_2.csv, tracking_week_3.csv, etc. use the data in all of the csv files in the nfl-big-data-bowl-2025 folder to create your analysis.

Overview
The National Football League (NFL) is back with another Big Data Bowl, where contestants use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. Previous iterations have analyzed running backs, defensive backs, special teams, pass rush plays, and tackling, and have generated metrics that have been used on television and by NFL teams.

This year's competition turns to a new type of data -- what happens before the snap -- to generate creative insights and actionable predictions into what the offense or defense does after the snap.

2025 Theme: Pre-snap to post-snap predictions
NFL offenses have 40 seconds in which to run a play. That time begins with substitutions, as players run on and off the field until both teams' personnel are configured. It continues into the play call, where both the offensive and defensive units learn their formation and assignments. It ends with myriad strategic decisions by the 22 players on the field, including motion, shifts, and alignment changes, designed to both confuse the opponent and capitalize on any advantages.

In all that action prior to the snap, both teams likely divulge patterns in what players will do after the snap. The goal of this year's competition aims to tell us just what those patterns are.

Examples to consider
Your challenge is generating actionable, practical, and novel insights from player tracking data corresponding to pre-snap team and player tendencies. Examples include, but are not limited to:

Play prediction (run v pass)
Scheme prediction (blitzes, run fits, route combinations, etc)
Player prediction (pass patterns, blocking assignments, etc)
Note that the above list is not exhaustive, and we encourage participants to be creative with their submissions.

Evaluation
Submission tracks
Participants will select one of three tracks in which to submit.

Undergraduate track. Open only to groups or individuals composed entirely of undergraduate students. Verification may be required to prove eligibility.
Metric track. Leverage pre-snap data to assess team or player performance and/or strategy to create a post-snap outcome. You may focus on offensive or defensive players, teams, or individuals. In general, the more narrow the focus, the better the paper.
Coaching presentation track. Analyze and present data in a submission designed for coaches (e.g, a scouting report). We encourage participants interested in this track to partner with a coach (or current/former player), though this isn’t required.
All submissions must explicitly state which track they are submitting to, and participants may not submit to multiple tracks.

Note: For this year, the Coaching Presentation Track will be requiring submissions in the form of a slide presentation saved as a PDF. Please upload your PDF slides as a Kaggle Dataset, and ensure that dataset is public prior to the submission deadline of January 6, 2025. In your submission form, please provide the URL to the Kaggle Dataset for review.

Scoring
An entry to the competition consists of a Notebook submission that is evaluated on the following four components, where 0 is the lowest and 10 is the highest.

Football Score (30%):

Would NFL teams (or the league office) be able to use these results on a week-to-week basis?
Does the analysis account for variables that make football data complex?
Are the ideas unique?
Data Science Score (30%):

Is the work correct?
Are claims backed up by data?
Are the statistical models appropriate given the data?
Are the analytical applications innovative?
Report Score (20%):

Is the report well-written?
Is the report easy to follow?
Is the motivation (metric, player evaluation, etc) clearly defined?
Data Visualization Score (20%)

Are the charts and tables provided accessible?
Are the charts and tables accurate?
Are the charts and tables innovative?
Judges will consist of analytics staffers that are working for (i) the 32 NFL teams, or (ii) player tracking vendors that work with NFL teams. Scores will be summarized using a weighed average (see above for each weight).

Notebook requirements
Undergraduate and Metric Track only.

Notebooks should contain no more than 2,000 words and less than ten tables/figures. Submissions over this limit may be subject to penalty. Participants are encouraged to show statistical code if it helps readers better understand their analyses. However, most code should be hidden in the Appendix.

All notebooks submitted must be made public on or before the submission deadline to be eligible. If submitting as a team, all team members must be listed as collaborators on all notebooks submitted.

Any notebook that doesn’t use the player tracking data will not be scored.
